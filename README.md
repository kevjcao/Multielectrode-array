# Multielectrode Array (MEA) analysis code to evaluate light responses
The code is a simplified version of the old Kramer MEA analysis code for retinal measurements. It processes spike-sorted .xlsx files from Plexon sorter, and can utilize trigger time .txt files. Use concatMEA to convert .mat files from Plexon into the corresponding .xlsx file for this code.

Code developed for the BENAQ-SBECD paper.
