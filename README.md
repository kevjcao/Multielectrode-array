# Multielectrode-array
The code is a simplified version of the old Kramer MEA analysis code for retinal measurements. It processes spike-sorted .xlsx files from Plexon sorter, and can utilize trigger time .txt files. 
Use concatMEA to convert .mat files from Plexon to the .xlsx files for this code.
